- The program use an enhanced for loop for display the content of the multidimensional array
to show all the 50 states and their respective capitals.

 - Them implements the bubble sort to sort the array comparing the elements using a nested for loop.

 - In the next part of the program we create a new instance of the Scanner class to handle the user input.
 - I choose StringBuilder over String in the for loop since String create a new object every time and
 StringBuilders work's on the same object.

 - To populate the Hashmap I used a for loop to traverse the array and add the values to the map
 using the states has the key and the capital has the value.
